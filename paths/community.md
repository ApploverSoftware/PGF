### What is it about?
Community is all about your contribution to a positive and supportive working environment at Applover. It also corresponds to willingness to spread love about Applover all around the world.

Community differs from other values in such that it is a value that is hard to be split into milestones - contribution to Applover's **community and evangelism** is not really something that can be mapped and evaluated into particular level and then grouped into milestone. Rather than that it is simply your attitude to building a positive working environment and sharing news about Applover in your network.

Although Community is somehow different from other values in its shape, it is no less vital than other values at Applover.
