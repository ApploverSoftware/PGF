### Who is a leader?
Leader is your own support in your long-term progression who helps you determine your career path and explore your strengths and weaknesses so that you can determine in which direction you would like to grow and how. Leader is the one who knows you best in terms of how you progress at work, what are your needs and expectations thus it is the person who should be able to give the best advice on your career path.

How does the leader know all this stuff? Because (s)heâ€™s catching up with you for 1on1 meetings to find out if youâ€™re feeling good at your career path and whether you have some requests to be fulfilled etc. Also (s)he gathers feedback from your teammates for you so that you can get to know whether youâ€™re doing good at your work and if thereâ€™s some room for improvement. Having such knowledge over a long time period your leader is able to help you determine what shall be the next steps in your career development.

The most important thing for you to know is that your leader is <b>here for you</b>, meaning that whenever you have some doubts, requests, questions and you donâ€™t know to whom you should turn to - just go to your leader! The golden rule should be as follows:
in case of any project-related issues - reach out to your project manager,
in case of any issues related directly to your profession - reach out to your teammates or your mentor,
in case of anything else you donâ€™t know what to do with - reach out to your leader.

### What can your leader help you with?
- define and suit your career path best to your strengths and needs,
- help you define your personal goals for nearest future,
- find a mentor for you who would be a best-match for your current personal goals,
- support you in running some team-wide or company-wide initiative, like some process improvement or defining new standards etc.,
- be there for you in case of any questions, requests (in case your leader wouldnâ€™t be able to help you, (s)he would redirect you to person in charge).

### What do you need to do as a leader?
- support your peers with choosing the personal goals and objectives to be achieved in the future,
- gather and process feedback for your peers so that you can then communicate the feedback to them periodically,
- try to be in constant contact with your peers to keep track of their wellbeing in their project and Applover by e.g. scheduling 1on1 meetings every month/few months,
- be open to all questions and requests from your peers so that you can solve their problems and try to fulfill their needs (e.g. with cooperation of the HR team, office team or - the board),
- take care of periodic team meetings (like team education meetings) to take place on regular basis - you're not responsible for their agenda, so you don't need to prepare presentations etc. but you should encourage team members to take part in such meetings and share their knowledge,
- support your team's integration by organising (and planning together with your team!) some time to be spent together (be it a pizza-eating sessions, karts racing on spending some time by board games) - each team has a plenty of budget to spend on integrations, reach out to HR team for more details,
- you can spend up to 16 hours a month for the above responsibilities.

### Things to keep in mind as a leader?
The most important part of being a leader is your relation with peers from your team. Remember that you're not the leader of the team but the leader of each of your peers (in case the particular team is big enough there might be a need of designating another leader in the team). That being said you should keep in mind that:
- you're not responsible for your team as a whole - you're not expected to drive whole team's development or set up any rules/standards followed in the team (it would be great if you do, of course, howevever it's not required from you to do it),
- you're not responsible for running any initiatives emerging from the team - anyone can step forward with ideas for improvements in the team/company and then run them (they will be given a dedicated time for such initiative),
- you're not responsible for assigning people to projects - you may be asked for advise from the PMs team or the board (that's one of the reasons why you're keeping an eye on your peers' development and their key competences) and suggest who would be a best fit for particular project.
