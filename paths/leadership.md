### Who is a leader?
Leader is your own support in your long-term progression who helps you determine your career path and explore your strengths and weaknesses so that you can determine in which direction you would like to grow and how. Leader is the one who knows you best in terms of how you progress at work, what are your needs and expectations thus it is the person who should be able to give the best advice on your career path.

How does the leader know all this stuff? Because (s)heâ€™s catching up with you for 1on1 meetings to find out if youâ€™re feeling good at your career path and whether you have some requests to be fulfilled etc. Also (s)he gathers feedback from your teammates for you so that you can get to know whether youâ€™re doing good at your work and if thereâ€™s some room for improvement. Having such knowledge over a long time period your leader is able to help you determine what shall be the next steps in your career development.

The most important thing for you to know is that your leader is <b>here for you</b>, meaning that whenever you have some doubts, requests, questions and you donâ€™t know to whom you should turn to - just go to your leader! The golden rule should be as follows:
in case of any project-related issues - reach out to your project manager,
in case of any issues related directly to your profession - reach out to your teammates or your mentor,
in case of anything else you donâ€™t know what to do with - reach out to your leader.

### What can your leader help you with?
- define and suit your career path best to your strengths and needs,
- help you define your personal goals for nearest future,
- find a mentor for you who would be a best-match for your current personal goals,
- be there for you in case of any questions, requests (in case your leader wouldnâ€™t be able to help you, (s)he would redirect you to person in charge).

### What do you need to do as a leader?
- support your peers with choosing the personal goals and objectives to be achieved in the future,
- gather and process feedback for your peers so that you can then communicate the feedback to them,
- try to be in constant contact with your peers to keep track of their wellbeing in their project and Applover by e.g. scheduling 1on1 meetings every month/few months,
- be open to all questions and requests from your peers so that you can solve their problems and try to fulfill their needs (e.g. with cooperation of the HR team, office team or - the board).
