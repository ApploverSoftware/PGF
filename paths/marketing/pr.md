### About our core paths
Core paths are directly related to professions we employ at Applover. Why exactly are these called **core**? Because they represent how you can progress at your profession at Applover. Each core path covers all the things we're looking for from Applover's team members.

### How does it work?
Each development path is divided into several milestones to be achieved along with your progression. Particular milestone represents a set of exemplary behaviors and skills that need to be mastered to accomplish the milestone.

### Things to keep in mind
- There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Applover as you grow.
- Your progression isnâ€™t an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.
- This isnâ€™t a checklist â€“ PGF is a guide that helps you understand how you can progress at your work.
- PGF is a living organism - we will modify existing milestones or add new ones to the core paths whenever we need to do so.
