### Who is a mentor?
Mentor is your own support in your professional development who helps you grow within your current field of interest (e.g. particular technology, framework etc. Mentor works with you closely on a daily basis in order to share their knowledge with you and pass their experience to you (e.g. through code review, pair programming, discussions on some issues, project audits etc.).

You will be assigned a mentor depending on the subject you are currently willing to learn. Your mentor does not necessarily need to be someone much more experienced than you - she/he can be equally skilled as you. 

You can expect your mentor to be experienced in the field that you currently want to deepen your knowledge so that you can squeeze as much as possible from the mentor-mentee relation. In case you would like to change your field of interest and learn something completely different you should ask your leader for changing the mentor - your leader will take care of finding you a mentor that would be able to pass their knowledge within your new area of interest to you.

Everyone can become a mentor while no one will force you to become one if you don’t feel like 🙂.

### What can your mentor help you with?
- broaden your knowledge and skills within particular area e.g. if you’d like to master React.js framework your mentor most likely will be someone who is already experienced with this framework,
- make code review for you,
- conduct technical audit of your work at project,
- help with solving technical issues in your project e.g. through technical discussions or pair programming.

### What do you need to do as a mentor?
- take care of your mentee’s growth in particular area,
- pass as much knowledge as you can to your mentee,
- try to provide as much availability as possible for your mentee in case she/he would need to discuss some issues/solutions,
- encourage you mentee to broaden their knowledge and skills by e.g. sharing some educational resources, useful articles etc.
