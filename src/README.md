This tool is forked from repository created by Monzo https://github.com/monzo/progression-framework.

## 🚀 Quick start

Static site is built in Gatsby, therefore You'll need the Gatsby CLI on your machine - if you don't have it, install it!
``` sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Next, navigate to the `progression-framework` directory and use yarn to get everything installed
``` sh
cd pgf
yarn
```

If you're developing locally, you can start up the site locally with hot loading ⚡
``` sh
gatsby develop
```

Finally, you can build everything into a set of static files 🛠️
``` sh
gatsby build
```
