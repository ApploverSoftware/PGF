Particular milestone represents a set of exemplary behaviors and skills that need to be mastered to accomplish the milestone. Some of the paths share common skills and behaviors (e.g. all paths related to development roles: Android, iOS, Frontend, Backend, Wordpress) - as a result each milestone for these is composed of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development skills - exemplary development skills and behaviors common for all developers at Applover.</li>\n<li>Mastery - exemplary skills and behaviors directly related to particular area of expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And thus all development roles' paths share the same set of <strong>Development skills</strong> throughout their milestones while they contain unique set of <strong>Mastery</strong> skills.</p>\n<h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Applover as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability as well as variety of soft skills.</li>\n<li>Your progression isn‚Äôt an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.</li>\n<li>This isn‚Äôt a checklist ‚Äì PGF is a
